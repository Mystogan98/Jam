# Donjons & Wagons

First aver game jam I made, you can play the game [here](https://github.com/Mystogan98/Jam/raw/master/Donjons%20%26%20Wagons.zip)

Remember to play in windowed mode or you'll have to alt+F4 out of the game.


We were in a group of 3 for this jam, I made all the code and game design, Théo made all the assets and Augustin made the musics and the most of the levels.
I am on the left in the credits, Théo is in the center and Augustin on the right.

This game is a rogue-like scroller, your goal is to avoid the bats and the moles as long as you can, while dodging the control-inverser portals and grabbing the power-ups.
Once dead, you'll be transported in the shop, where you will be able to use a grapnel to take the buff of your choice. Then you'll be back in the infinite scroller.

Use ZQSD or the arrows to move your wagon. Use left mouse to grab a buff in the shop.
